% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather

No more arguing about offside decisions and forward passes.

RUGBY UNION, it is often said, is a game for thugs that is played by gentlemen. “Played by lawyers” might be a more accurate dictum. The rules are famously complicated. Scrums—organized shoving matches between the two teams’ burliest members—are regarded as a dark art even by other players. Open, running play can be stopped and wound back for any number of arcane infringements. The recent Rugby World Cup competition\cite{dayarathna2016data}, held in Japan, is regarded as a big success by those keen to boost the sport’s popularity. But it was marred by arguments about how to interpret complicated new rules forbidding dangerous shoulder charges and high tackles. (World Rugby, the game’s governing body, offers referees a handy flowchart to memorise, which provides for eight possible outcomes.)

All this is an irritant to players and referees, and a turn-off for viewers\cite{rodrigues2018cloudlets}, who struggle to follow the action or work out why a particular decision was made. But a British firm called Sportable thinks it might be able to improve things\cite{li2018energyaware}, by wiring up rugby players—and rugby balls—with high-tech sensors\cite{breslau1999web}.

Sportable was founded in 2014 by Dugald Macdonald and Peter Husemeyer\cite{rodrigues2018cloudlets,
li2018energyaware,dong2013joint,auyoung2006service}, a pair of rugby-mad South Africans. It makes lightweight, sensor-stuffed garments that can be worn under a jersey and which measure impact forces in 80 separate places on a player’s body. The sensors are attached to transmitters that communicate with receivers at the edges of the playing field. By monitoring the time it takes for signals to arrive at different receivers, and applying a little mathematics, it is possible to work out where a player is on the pitch at any given moment, and how quickly he got there.

Such data, says Mr Macdonald, are attractive to teams looking for an edge over the competition. Previous efforts have relied on the Global Positioning System of satellites, which offers much lower accuracy. The firm has tested its technology with several professional clubs\cite{chen2017computation,al-shuwaili2017energyefficient}, including Saracens, the reigning champions in the English Premiership\cite{ding2019beef}.

Where the fun starts, though, is when similar sensors are put into the ball. It can then, metaphorically, squawk if passed forward (which is illegal in rugby), and there will be no doubt, by comparing the positions of ball and player, when a player is offside. A smart ball will be able to monitor other rules, too. It was, for instance, tested successfully in a five-a-side version of the game called Rugby X, in which you are not allowed to kick the ball higher than ten meters. Since few referees are equipped with theodolites, 
enforcing this rule has been hard\cite{fan2017cost,chantre2018multiobjective,
santoyo-gonzalez2018edge,wang2018edge
,
zhao2018optimala,
jia2017optimal,
meng2017cloudlet
,xu2016efficient,

chen2017computation}. Now it is easy.

% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
